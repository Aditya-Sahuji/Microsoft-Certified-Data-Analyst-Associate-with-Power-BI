## Analyzing and Visualizing Data with Microsoft Power BI
The BI industry is booming, and every day, more hiring managers and recruiters are looking for professionals who not only know their way around BI tools, but have certifications to back their claims.

Knowing this, what are you doing to let everyone know you mean business?

Becoming Power BI certified is a must if you want to remain competitive in the analytics job market. Employers need to know that you can use their BI stack without training, and certifications do just that—they endorse the skills that can’t be measured on a resume, portfolio, or in an interview.

By mastering Power BI, you become more efficient at work and are able to communicate and uncover deeper insights than before. You also gain the confidence to lead more projects and solve complex business challenges.

And that's where this course comes into play.


So, get ready for your Power BI certification and master everything you need to know to pass the DA-100 exam. Learn to prepare, model, visualize, and analyze data; deploy and maintain deliverables in Power BI. Plus, DAX, advanced data visualization techniques, and more.
